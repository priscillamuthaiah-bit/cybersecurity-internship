CYBERSECURITY BASICS



CIA Triad



The CIA triad represents the three core principles of cybersecurity:



Confidentiality – ensuring data is only accessible to authorized users.



Integrity – protecting data from unauthorized modification.



Availability – making sure systems and data are accessible when needed.

I learned that every security control (firewalls, encryption, backups) supports one or more of these principles.



Threat Types



Threats are anything that can cause harm to a system. Common types include:



Malware (viruses, worms, ransomware)



Phishing and social engineering



Insider threats



Denial of Service (DoS) attacks

Understanding threat types helps in predicting what kind of attacks a system may face.



Attack Vectors



Attack vectors are the paths attackers use to enter a system, such as:



Unpatched software



Weak passwords



Malicious email attachments



Open ports and services

Learning attack vectors helped me understand how small weaknesses can be exploited.
