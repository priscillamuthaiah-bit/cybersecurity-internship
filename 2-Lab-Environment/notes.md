LAB ENVIRONMENT



Install VirtualBox



VirtualBox is used to run virtual machines. I used it to create a safe testing environment without affecting my main system.



Install Kali Linux



Kali Linux is a penetration testing operating system with built-in security tools. I installed it as my attacker machine.



Install DVWA



DVWA (Damn Vulnerable Web Application) is a deliberately vulnerable web app. I use it to practice finding and understanding common web vulnerabilities.



Configure Host-Only Network



I configured a host-only adapter so that my attacker (Kali) and victim (DVWA) can communicate securely inside the lab without exposing them to the internet.
