LINUX FUNDAMENTAL



File System Navigation



I learned basic commands such as:



pwd – shows current directory



ls – lists files



cd – changes directory

These commands help in moving around the Linux file system.



File \& Directory Permissions



Commands like chmod and chown control who can read, write, or execute files.

This helped me understand how Linux enforces access control.



Package Management



apt is used to install and update software



dpkg manages installed packages

This allows me to install tools like nmap and wireshark properly.



Networking Commands



ifconfig – view network interfaces



ping – test connectivity



netstat – view open ports



traceroute – trace packet paths

These commands help in basic network troubleshooting.
