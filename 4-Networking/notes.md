NETWORKING BASICS



OSI Model



The OSI model has 7 layers, from Physical to Application.

It helps me understand where security controls like firewalls and encryption operate.



TCP/IP Protocol Suite



TCP/IP defines how data is transmitted over networks.

TCP ensures reliable delivery, while IP handles addressing and routing.



DNS \& HTTP/HTTPS



DNS converts domain names into IP addresses.



HTTP transfers web data in plain text.



HTTPS uses encryption (TLS) for secure communication.

This showed me why HTTPS is important for protecting user data.



IP Addressing \& Subnetting



IP addressing identifies devices on a network.

Subnetting divides networks into smaller parts for better management and security.

NAT allows private IPs to access the internet using a public IP.
