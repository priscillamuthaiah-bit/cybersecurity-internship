CRYPTOGRAPHY BASICS



Symmetric vs Asymmetric Encryption



Symmetric uses the same key for encryption and decryption (AES).



Asymmetric uses public and private keys (RSA).

I learned how each is used in secure communication.



Hashing



Hashing converts data into a fixed-length value.

Algorithms like MD5 and SHA256 are used to verify data integrity.



Digital Certificates \& SSL/TLS



Certificates verify the identity of websites.

SSL/TLS encrypts communication between client and server.



OpenSSL Hands-on



I practiced encrypting and decrypting messages using OpenSSL to understand how encryption works in real systems.
